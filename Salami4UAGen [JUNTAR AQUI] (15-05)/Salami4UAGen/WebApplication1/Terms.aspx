        <h1>Salami4UA Terms of Service</h1>
        <p>

            Welcome to Salami4UA! <br /><br />
            Thanks for using our products and services.<br />
            By using our Services, you are agreeing to these terms. Please read them carefully. <br /><br />
            Using our Services<br />
            You must follow any policies made available to you within the Services.
            Don’t misuse our Services. For example, don’t interfere with our Services or try to access them using 
            a method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide. You may use our Services only 
            as permitted by law, including applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations. We may suspend 
            or stop providing our Services to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies or if we are 
            investigating suspected misconduct.<br /><br />

            Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or 
            the content you access. You may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its 
            owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or 
            logos used in our Services. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with 
            our Services.<br /><br />
            Our Services display some content that is not Salami4UA’s. This content is the sole responsibility of the 
            entity that makes it available. We may review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our 
            policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies 
            or the law. But that does not necessarily mean that we review content, so please don’t assume that we do.
            In connection with your use of the Services, we may send you service announcements, administrative messages,
            and other information. You may opt out of some of those communications.<br /><br />

            Some of our Services are available on mobile devices. Do not use such Services in a way that distracts 
            you and prevents you from obeying traffic or safety laws.<br /><br />

            Your Salami4UA Account<br />

            You may need a Salami4UA Account in order to use some of our Services. You may create your own Salami4UA Account, 
            or your Salami4UA Account may be assigned to you by an administrator, such as your employer or educational 
            institution. If you are using a Salami4UA Account assigned to you by an administrator, different or additional 
            terms may apply and your administrator may be able to access or disable your account.<br /><br />

            To protect your Salami4UA Account, keep your password confidential. You are responsible for the activity that 
            happens on or through your Salami4UA Account. Try not to reuse your Salami4UA Account password on third-party 
            applications. If you learn of any unauthorized use of your password or Salami4UA Account, follow these 
            instructions.<br /><br />

            Privacy and Copyright Protection<br />

            Salami4UA’s privacy policies explain how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use our 
            Services. By using our Services, you agree that Salami4UA can use such data in accordance with our privacy 
            policies.<br />

            We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminate accounts of repeat infringers 
            according to the process set out in the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act.<br /><br />

            We provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online. If you think 
            somebody is violating your copyrights and want to notify us, you can find information about submitting 
            notices and Salami4UA’s policy about responding to notices in our Help Center .<br /><br />

            Your Content in our Services<br />

            Some of our Services allow you to upload, submit, store, send or receive content. You retain ownership 
            of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that content. In short, what belongs to you stays 
            yours.<br /><br />

            When you upload, submit, store, send or receive content to or through our Services, you give Salami4UA 
            (and those we work with) a worldwide license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative 
            works (such as those resulting from translations, adaptations or other changes we make so that your 
            content works better with our Services), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and 
            distribute such content. The rights you grant in this license are for the limited purpose of operating, 
            promoting, and improving our Services, and to develop new ones. This license continues even if you stop 
            using our Services (for example, for a business listing you have added to Salami4UA Maps). Some Services may 
            offer you ways to access and remove content that has been provided to that Service. Also, in some of our 
            Services, there are terms or settings that narrow the scope of our use of the content submitted in those 
            Services. Make sure you have the necessary rights to grant us this license for any content that you submit 
            to our Services.<br /><br />

            Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product 
            features, such as customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection. 
            This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.<br />

            If you have a Salami4UA Account, we may display your Profile name, Profile photo, and actions you take on 
            Salami4UA or on third-party applications connected to your Salami4UA Account (such as +1’s, reviews you write 
            and comments you post) in our Services, including displaying in ads and other commercial contexts. We 
            will respect the choices you make to limit sharing or visibility settings in your Salami4UA Account. For 
            example, you can choose your settings so your name and photo do not appear in an ad.<br /><br />

            You can find more information about how Salami4UA uses and stores content in the privacy policy or additional 
            terms for particular Services. If you submit feedback or suggestions about our Services, we may use your 
            feedback or suggestions without obligation to you.<br /><br />

            About Software in our Services<br />

            When a Service requires or includes downloadable software, this software may update automatically on your 
            device once a new version or feature is available. Some Services may let you adjust your automatic update 
            settings.<br /><br />

            Salami4UA gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the 
            software provided to you by Salami4UA as part of the Services. This license is for the sole purpose of 
            enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by Salami4UA, in the manner permitted 
            by these terms. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our Services or included 
            software, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws 
            prohibit those restrictions or you have our written permission.<br />

            Open source software is important to us. Some software used in our Services may be offered under an open 
            source license that we will make available to you. There may be provisions in the open source license 
            that expressly override some of these terms.<br /><br />

            Modifying and Terminating our Services<br />

            We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may add or remove functionalities or features, 
            and we may suspend or stop a Service altogether.

            You can stop using our Services at any time, although we’ll be sorry to see you go. Salami4UA may 
            also stop providing Services to you, or add or create new limits to our Services at any time.

            We believe that you own your data and preserving your access to such data is important. 
            If we discontinue a Service, where reasonably possible, we will give you reasonable advance 
            notice and a chance to get information out of that Service.<br /><br />

            Our Warranties and Disclaimers<br />

            We provide our Services using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care and we hope that you 
            will enjoy using them. But there are certain things that we don’t promise about our Services.

            OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THESE TERMS OR ADDITIONAL TERMS, NEITHER Salami4UA NOR ITS SUPPLIERS 
            OR DISTRIBUTORS MAKE ANY SPECIFIC PROMISES ABOUT THE SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON’T MAKE ANY 
            COMMITMENTS ABOUT THE CONTENT WITHIN THE SERVICES, THE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS OF THE SERVICES, OR THEIR 
            RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS. WE PROVIDE THE SERVICES “AS IS”.<br />

            SOME JURISDICTIONS PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN WARRANTIES, LIKE THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, 
            FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE EXCLUDE 
            ALL WARRANTIES.<br /><br />

            Liability for our Services<br />

            WHEN PERMITTED BY LAW, Salami4UA, AND Salami4UA’S SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE 
            FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUES, OR DATA, FINANCIAL LOSSES OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, 
            OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.<br />

            TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF Salami4UA, AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, 
            FOR ANY CLAIMS UNDER THESE TERMS, INCLUDING FOR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU 
            PAID US TO USE THE SERVICES (OR, IF WE CHOOSE, TO SUPPLYING YOU THE SERVICES AGAIN).<br />

            IN ALL CASES, Salami4UA, AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE 
            THAT IS NOT REASONABLY FORESEEABLE.<br /><br />

            Business uses of our Services<br />

            If you are using our Services on behalf of a business, that business accepts these terms. It will 
            hold harmless and indemnify Salami4UA and its affiliates, officers, agents, and employees from any claim, 
            suit or action arising from or related to the use of the Services or violation of these terms, including 
            any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, suits, judgments, litigation costs and 
            attorneys’ fees.<br /><br />

            About these Terms<br />

            We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect 
            changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms regularly. We’ll post 
            notice of modifications to these terms on this page. We’ll post notice of modified additional terms 
            in the applicable Service. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner 
            than fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or 
            changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms 
            for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service.<br /><br />

            If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will control 
            for that conflict.<br />

            These terms control the relationship between Salami4UA and you. They do not create any third party 
            beneficiary rights.<br />

            If you do not comply with these terms, and we don’t take action right away, this doesn’t mean 
            that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).<br />

            If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.<br />

            <br /><br />
